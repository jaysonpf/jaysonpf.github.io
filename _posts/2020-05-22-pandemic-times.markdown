In this moment we are in middle of most powerful pandemic since early 1900's. 

I thought it would be great to share some thoughts here.  I am curious to, in the future, after everything get back to normal, to read this post again and see if I was right or not.

I am very optimistic, here are some of good changes in our society that will happen:


## 1. Working from home 

Working from home will be more common than never. Every IT company will offer some positions that are flexible to work from home. Other companies outside of IT will start offering more remote positions as well. 
 Not every person likes to work remotely and I think 100% working remotely is not best option for a high integrate and productive team, every team has to find a balance between amount of days working remote and working in the office. 
 While IT companies will give this decision to theirs teams, the non-IT companies will starting to oficially allow remote work.

 ## 2. Work productivity & well-being

With more people working from home, there will be less traffic jams, less time wasted in traffic. Everyone will have more time to spend with interesting things that will help them to become better persons, it can be doing courses or speeding more time with their family.
 Speeding more time with families will avoid cases of depression. 
 
## 3. Environment change

Fewer cars in the streets every day will help decrease air pollution. 
Some governments will spend more money in renewable energy after the instability of oil price. 

## 4. World union

 This disease showed to us that everyone is the same, it doesnâ€™t matter if you are rich or poor, if you are born in developed country or not, everyone is the same. 
 Therefore, the world will be more united to fight every disease. We will be more prepared for next pandemic, to eliminate it in beginning, and avoid the chaos that is happing today.

## 5. Personal hygiene

Everyone will be willing to adopt more hygienic behaviors around the world, some cultures already have good hygiene habits others not. After this pandemic everyone will be changed and will clean the hands more often, will avoid getting in the house with dirty shoes etc.  With this change millions of lives will be saved due to common diseases that will be avoided.
